# Telco Dataset Evaluation

## About The Project

### Goals

My goal for this project is to create a model that will predict customer churn using the telco dataset. My target variable is churn and I will evaluate a variety of independent variables to identify drivers of churn.

### Background

We are given a Sql dataset that we are importing and converting to a csv file. Then, we are using our skills in data prep to clean the data and make it possible to model. I will be using different models including logistic regression, decision tree, and random forrest. I will be looking for variable coefficients to predict possible relationships to churn.

## Initial Hypothesis 

Null Hypothesis- There is no correlation between churn and method of payment.

Alternative Hypothesis- There is a significant relationship between churn and method of payment.
